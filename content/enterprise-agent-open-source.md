Adhering to our set purpose as globally operating cloud company to help the world run better and improve people’s lives, SAP decided to&nbsp;<strong>conclude the commercialization&nbsp;</strong>of its&nbsp;on-premise&nbsp;database product&nbsp;<strong>SAP Enterprise OrientDB.&nbsp;</strong>

Acknowledging the&nbsp;importance of the functional scope provided by this solution and its relevance to our installed base customers it became apparent that a continued availability of bespoke capabilities would be the desired goal. Accordingly, SAP agreed to transition SAP Enterprise OrientDB into an&nbsp;<strong>Open-Source</strong>&nbsp;Solution,&nbsp;<strong>effective immediately</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Existing capabilities will be&nbsp;provisioned&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<strong>OrientDB&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;agent</strong>&nbsp;available as Add-on to the established open-source Community Edition of OrientDB.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>What do you need to know?&nbsp;</h2>

&nbsp;

The&nbsp;<strong>open-source solution OrientDB&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;agent</strong>&nbsp;will be available&nbsp;as of today&nbsp;and run under Apache&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;license, same as the Community Edition of OrientDB already&nbsp;does&nbsp;today.&nbsp;

There will be no need for&nbsp;installed base&nbsp;customers to adjust their licenses or trigger any migration of their SAP Enterprise OrientDB installations in place. Furthermore, no changes apply to the release cycle and packaging except that the future roadmap will be determined and driven by the OrientDB open-source community in future. SAP will remain being part of this&nbsp;community&nbsp;as a member.&nbsp;

The&nbsp;provision of&nbsp;<strong>maintenance</strong>&nbsp;for SAP Enterprise OrientDB&nbsp;by SAP&nbsp;<strong>will end on 31.12.2023</strong>. Accordingly, existing&nbsp;support&nbsp;agreements cannot be extended beyond that date and&nbsp;<strong>auto-renewal clauses</strong>&nbsp;for existing subscription contracts&nbsp;<strong>will be ceased</strong>&nbsp;as&nbsp;of now. Please reach out to your appointed Account Executive in case of any concerns.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>What is the expected impact&nbsp;on&nbsp;me?&nbsp;</h2>

&nbsp;

SAP purposely opted for a&nbsp;<strong>transition path</strong>&nbsp;that is most smooth and&nbsp;<strong>non-disruptive</strong>&nbsp;for our installed base customers,&nbsp;and as such there is&nbsp;<strong>no technical preparation or migration&nbsp;activities</strong> incurred&nbsp;on your side. In case you are already running productively on a local installation of SAP Enterprise OrientDB,&nbsp;<strong>you can just&nbsp;proceed</strong>&nbsp;to do so.&nbsp;

Installed base customers can continue to refer to the technical&nbsp;<a href="http://orientdb.org/docs/3.2.x/admin/installation/">installation</a>- and&nbsp;<a href="https://orientdb.org/docs/3.2.x/release/Upgrade.html">upgrade</a>-guides for updates,&nbsp;<strong>release-cycles and packaging</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

With&nbsp;SAP&nbsp;<strong>maintenance ending on 31.12.2023</strong>&nbsp;existing subscription&nbsp;contracts will not be renewed. Exceptional cases may be considered until&nbsp;maximum&nbsp;this date&nbsp;if required&nbsp;– please reach out to your Account Executive in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<strong>Perpetual licenses</strong>&nbsp;need to be converted into respective&nbsp;<strong>term-licenses until maximum this date</strong>&nbsp;– please reach out to&nbsp;your <strong>Account Executive</strong>&nbsp;for more details and to trigger the next steps.&nbsp;

<strong>As of 01.01.2024</strong>&nbsp;support will only be available through the&nbsp;open-source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues">OrientDB community</a>&nbsp;(see also related links below). You will&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;be able to open&nbsp;<strong>support tickets via the SAP Support Portal&nbsp;</strong>and the respective&nbsp;<strong>component will no longer be available</strong>&nbsp;within the SAP Support&nbsp;System.&nbsp;
