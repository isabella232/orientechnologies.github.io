# OrientDB, the First Multi-Model Database

OrientDB is the first Multi-Model Open Source NoSQL DBMS that combines the power of graphs and the flexibility of documents into one scalable, high-performance operational database.

Gone are the days where your database only supports a single data model. As a direct response to polyglot persistence, multi-model databases acknowledge the need for multiple data models, combining them to reduce operational complexity and maintain data consistency. Though graph databases have grown in popularity, most NoSQL products are still used to provide scalability to applications sitting on a relational DBMS. Advanced 2nd generation NoSQL products like OrientDB are the future: providing more functionality and flexibility, while being powerful enough to replace your operational DBMS.

### Speed 

OrientDB was engineered from the ground up with performance as a key specification. Itâ€™s fast on both read and write operations. 

- No more Joins: relationships are physical links to the records.
- Better RAM use.
- Traverses parts of or entire trees and graphs of records in milliseconds.
- Traversing speed is not affected by the database size.
